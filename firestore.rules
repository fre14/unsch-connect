/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for UNSCH Connect Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private data and allows public read access for certain collections like 'announcements' and 'posts'.
 * Password reset tokens are carefully secured to prevent abuse.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /userProfiles/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /posts/{postId}: Stores user-generated posts. Publicly readable, but only the author can modify or delete.
 * - /posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments on posts.
 * - /announcements/{announcementId}: Stores university announcements. Publicly readable.
 * - /userProfiles/{userId}/academicSchedules/{scheduleId}: Stores user's academic schedules. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /passwordResetTokens/{tokenId}: Stores password reset tokens. Requires special handling to prevent abuse.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - Public read access is granted to the 'announcements' collection, assuming that all documents within are safe to expose.
 * - All write operations are strictly controlled based on ownership or specific roles.
 * - Data validation is limited to fields crucial for authorization and relational integrity to allow for flexible data shapes during prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The rules rely on denormalized data, such as the `authorId` field in the `Post` entity, to make authorization decisions without additional reads.
